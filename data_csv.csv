#Druzhba is not the only pipeline in Ukraine.

@nicsadventure @HalimaNyomi not really Russia is fighting EU and US not just Ukraine thats why its a prolonged war &amp; they doing a good job too.
‼️🇷🇺 Putin knows what the US is up to: When the war in Ukraine ends, this is what begins‼️

 🏴‍☠️ NATO has begun deploying additional military contingents in Eastern Europe, and modernizing military infrastructure near Russia's borders. 👇
@AndyBurnhamGM @MetroMayorSteve Andy supports Ukraine 
If he types Ukrainian war crimes on Telegram and still supports them then I say he’s a Nazi
Russia deliberately bombs civilians in Ukraine. Its army loots, rapes, &amp; massacres wherever it occupies Ukrainian land. It is both only lawful under the laws of war &amp; humane for Ukrainian civilians to help Ukrainian forces strike military targets inside Russia.

@keithamccluske1 @itsy_bitsy_spy @Lyla_lilas This was not a civil war but a 🇷🇺 invasion, so 🇺🇸 could have done a lot. Provide official protection to 🇺🇦, like they did for 🇸🇪. Position their armies in Ukraine. Start military exchange agreements, etc…

Instead they did nothing.
@DanieleZuddas Putin ha 70 anni: ha quasi raggiunto l'aspettativa di vita dei russi, che sotto la sua presidenza s'è allungata di 7 anni. Dopo più di 20 anni di schiumate invidiose, lo vedrete spirare nel suo letto: il più grande e vittorioso leader della sua generazione https://t.co/JQfxeqAuWH
@dmartyn76 @Natasha_abe2002 Vietnam was just one of the first in a long line of fucked up “wars” we had no business starting. It’s no different than Ukraine. I voluntarily joined during the GWOT and wouldn’t think twice about dodging a draft for some bullshit war that has nothing to do with US.
@squatsons As a veteran, the war in Ukraine is treason by Biden. There's things that will take years to hear about, and they are so horrific most will say it's not possible. Russia will win this war and destroy NATO, Russia is around for Armageddon, America isn't mentioned.
@AsfandBhittani Yes &amp; not only did the US fund and train Massood &amp; Hekmatyar BEFORE the USSR invasion *knowing* it would lead to an invasion, they planned funding them well before that.

The US works on 20 year military plans. This is why Obomba was making plans to withdraw in 2015 Ukraine war https://t.co/YbgFDlVbJt

@Spriter99880 He was the president of a country in the middle of a quiet civil war for years. A large part of Ukraine wanted to align with Russia. He did nothing to resolve the issue.

No, it was not a priority for President Trump, but it would hav been as Russia was preparing to invade.

3476,@Blop80 @ZelenskyyUa Please learn the history of the region. Since 2014 ukranian forces have been bombing russians in Donbass. If Putin can keep the pro russian zones of Ukraine this war end tomorrow and no one else needs to die.
3477,@Alex_Oloyede2 nato should force zelensky to go and live in Ukraine...let him feel the heat of war and then ask him if willing to talk with russia... so long as he's hiding in the usa war room he will not feel the fear..

19111,Correction: high salinity AND organic compounds result in overpopulation of cyanobacteria. As it could be the case of highly contaminated waters like those of the Salton sea

The high salinity results only in a permanent overpopulation of cyanobacteria which almost no species of vegetation can withstand https://t.co/EMbXbcmbvX https://t.co/RmaL2edH9a

19598,Choosing a vegan lifestyle is not just about what you eat; it's a compassionate choice that extends to all beings. #veganism 🌱
19599,I generally agree with this though vegetarianism + eggs would be fine. Veganism I think takes it too far. As for myself I just acknowledge this is a moral failing on my part &amp; if had a stronger will or access to cheap &amp; tasty alternatives I would go with them over meat. https://t.co/2oXu58TcJu

19603,@RealWindows95 @punishedmother I feel the proper way to talk about
19604,veganism is to separate it entirely from the
19605,perspective of anti-cruelty.

19620,@wanderingerrant @vegan_logic Veganism isn’t a diet. It’s a philosophy based on animal rights. He was never vegan. He may have been following a plant based diet which is different.
19621,If low carb veganism died out veganism would get less hate. Fruit-based vegans look better and are less annoying/preachy than the typical soy-based vegan 
19622,Fruit enjoyers are shredded but soy enjoyers just look like AIDS patients
19623,@punishedmother I’d obviously support legislation for better treatment of Animals and even things that would hurt the meat industry solely so as a society we can move away from it. Veganism is more ethical than eating meat however I just don’t think it is a prerequisite for being a leftist.

19710,@punishedmother I don't lose sleep over what happens to creatures that can barely think in industries designed to expedite their slaughter. I just don't. Most people don't either. Veganism relies primarily on guilt to propagate and I and many others just don't feel that way.
19711,@punishedmother And of course there’s the fact that until actual systems change veganism cannot do anything to counter the proliferation of factory farming. It’s like recycling where it’s assigning individual blame for a systemic issue.

19716,Veganism is hard. I've never been able to manage it. But the people who want to go out of their way to stop other people from being vegan are really something.
19717,@punishedmother the veganism debate is the only time people think it’s morally good to police other people’s diets. what you consume is personal &amp; i don’t believe anyone should be shamed for the food they consume - especially strangers

19725,and veganism is just empirically cheaper than non vegan diets. The it's only more expensive if you eat vegan by using vegan replacements rather eating vegan food. Eg buying vegan cheese instead of just not having cheese.

19810,@Corny_Kelleher @s_baryCFC @AlexGoldberg_ I’m not advocating for véganism
19811,@asheuriii veganism is a middle class luxury option at the moment at least in the UK. It’s possible to get all the nutrients needed for a healthy diet but it’s not cheap and there is little variety. Not everyone can afford to be vegan especially if they are on a low income.
19812,@NkyTptn_ I simply mean that these are two words that are frequently used together to deflect in conversations about veganism.
19813,@hakimabuyasin @JamesMelville @georgegalloway Awwww....No!  The amount of land and resources needed to raise cattle vs used to eat plants on the same land is much greater.  It is better for the environment to have a mostly plant based and non-organic farming diet. Methane was never used as the main argument for veganism
19814,This. The number of progressives I’ve met that “don’t get veganism” is shocking.
19815,You don’t have to be vegan to understand that speciesism has allowed humans to justify our cruel treatment of other animals.

Additionally our poor planet can’t support animal agriculture. Some nutrients are less bioavaible from plants but we don’t need animal products to thrive.
21595,@PhilipMPowell I define a vegan as a human *committed* to veganism.  I don’t consider anyone a vegan (committed to veganism) who doesn’t take the commitment seriously or doesn’t have any strong reasons for believing that veganism is a moral minimum standard.

22286,Maybe this is the influence of Singer - because he writes about speciesism in those terms but not veganism - being categorically against animal use
22287,What confuses me about a lot of Utilitarian/Effective Altruists writing about animals is they will take a categorical value position on being anti-speciesist and use quite forceful language on that being a moral obligation but tone it down when it comes to veganism 1/2
22288,Survey says that omnivores are very put off by vegan activism and that sounds bad but half those people probably wouldn't even know veganism exists if not for activism so really the activism has to keep happening for long term benefits

22720,@georgia_bremner @morgancrawf Veganism isn’t a dietary preference it’s a justice movement. You might be thinking of plant based. Regardless I think the point of the tweet “super” whistled over your head.
22721,@zhellno @sibaburck @beigehydrangeas It will most likely be similar to any other Joeys debate. Probably super easy tbh. Someone who has never debated veganism will get absolutely cooked by Joey.
22722, I really don't understand how doing activism in front of huge young audiance is a bad thing.

22790,@MakeItWayne151 I have no tolerance for picky eaters. Allergy? Commitment to vegetarianism/veganism etc? Yes. Refuse to eat because it’s icky? NO.
22791,I really cannot stand the vegan community 8/10 times and it is a HUGE reason why I refuse to really promote my veganism on my platforms. The vegan community is SO judgmental and rarely has made me feel comfortable being apart of it and it’s predominantly white cis people
22792,You can’t call veganism a cult or a religion because all vegan claims can be tangibly proven.  They aren’t systems of belief or opinions. They are facts. What you do with those facts if you disagree is a religion.

22798,We don't all believe in veganism. I don't like how the sausage gets made either but I want my sausage to taste good.
22799,i don't have enough fear of discourse bc i have a text post from january 2020 that has almost 168k notes on tumblr. the post is about veganism being disconnected from agricultural reality. you cannot kill me in a way that matters
22800,People STAY using the “Veganism is for the privileged &amp; rich” approach as if I didn’t become vegan while living in the hood living paycheck to paycheck. It’s actually CHEAPER to be vegan. I spend less money now than when I wasn’t vegan. Shut the fuck up with that lame ass excuse.
22801,@redstoneprime15 @VesuviusFloof15 @GuaireSCP @piccadickky @DaRealRexinald @wildlifeco1 @ausar_the @zhellno @SAuR1An Yea large producers often cut corners and such. Unfortunately there’s a lot of factors in dietary needs &amp; such.
22802,@hitchinheating @BornTo_BeFree Because vegans like the taste of meat but dont want to murder sentinent beings. Veganism is an ethical stance NOT a diet.

@ElRepepero @el_pais Wow, Isabel Diaz Ayuso's solution to climate change is truly groundbreaking -- I'm sure a single plant per balcony will save the planet in no time. Maybe she should also suggest everyone keep a goldfish in their bathtub to solve the water crisis.
@AndrewDessler It’s also possible to accept that anthropogenic climate change has scientific merit w/o accepting alarmist claims of imminent catastrophe.

Frankly, if you want acceptance from the public, you should focus your efforts on those making alarmist predictions that won’t come true.
